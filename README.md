# baps

I wanted something to use to learn Angular 19 and demonstrate .NET Core API.

My idea is BAPS*.  It's a messaging system where customers can make a request for some food for their event / meeting etc.  They say what they want and when they want it. 

_*IYKYK_

This message will be matched with appropriate Producers who will quote for the delivery.

The Quotes are sent back to the Customer who will accept one which sends an acceptance back to the Producer.

### Technologies to be used:
* Angular 19
* .NET Core API
* Cosmos DB
* Azure Service Bus
* Azure Functions
* .NET Aspire (possibly)
